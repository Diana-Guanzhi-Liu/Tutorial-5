# Overview
This repository is for the discussion on the increase of nonresponse rates of surveys in the Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology. There are three papers publised in the issue on nonresponse rates in face-to-face surveys, phone surveys, and web surveys respectively. They found that nonresponse rates are increasing at around 1% a year for face-to-face and phone surveys and are stable but lower for web surveys. This means that institutions conducting surveys need to consider the cost benefits tradeoffs of long-term and large-scale studies. More work needs to be done to determine if web surveys' low response rate indicates nonresponse bias and if certain survey features can increase response rates.
